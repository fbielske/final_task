Final project for CodeAcademy course egzamination. An app for adding, editting and removing users to a list.

I used React.js (TypeScript) with backend server of Node.js (TypeScript) and MongoDB as database. Other dependancies include: express, mongoose, cors, dotenv, vite.

I adopted Bulma component styles as well as colors and achieved it by creating them with styled-components.

### Setup

First, download or clone the repository
Second, create .env file with your MongoDB URI and place it at dir: server/.env

### Getting Started

Open the terminal on the main folder and write command: ./start-dev.sh
Open http://localhost:5173 with your browser to see the result.
You can edit the page by modifying client/src/App.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

If you want to activate frontend and backend seperately: -- At your terminal cd to either client or server -- Run npm ci to update files and then npm run dev
